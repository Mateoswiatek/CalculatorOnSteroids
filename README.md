# CalculatorOnSteroids - Simple Mathematical Expressions Generator
This project aims to implement data structures for representing and manipulating simple mathematical expressions as graphs.
The project is not based on parsing text expressions, but creates a graph representation using appropriately constructed code.

Features:
- Creation of mathematical expressions
- Calculation of expression/function values for different variable values
- Displaying expressions

Analyzing the expression 2x^3 + x^2 - 2x + 7 reveals its components as:
- Constants (e.g., 2 and 7)
- Variables (x)
- Power functions (x^3, x^2) â€“ Power(arg,p)
- Multiplication operations - Prod(args...)
- Addition operations - Sum(args...)


# Potential for Further Development / Ideas

## Adding New Mathematical Functions:
Expand the project's capabilities by implementing various mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions:
- sine, cosine, tangent
- exponential functions (e.g., e^x).
- Symbolic differentiation

## Interactive User Interface:
 Create an interactive user interface (GUI/CLI) enabling users to
 input, edit, and compute values of mathematical expressions seamlessly.
